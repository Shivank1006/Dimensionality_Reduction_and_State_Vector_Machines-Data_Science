# Dimensionality Reduction and State Vector Machines
Data Science Course Assignment - Indian Institute of Technology Ropar

## Abstract

This assignment summarizes the results of dimensionality reduction and visualization
performed on various datasets. It also includes the variation of results by tuning the
parameters while using the SVMs for the classification on Iris Dataset. The datasets
used in this assignment are Labelled Faces in the Wild and Fisher Iris dataset. The
main techniques used in this assignment include Principal Component Analysis, tSNE
and LDA. It also includes the results of SVM classification with varying parameters


All the results, figures and tables are given in the <a href='Assignment_Report.pdf'>Assignment Report</a>.
